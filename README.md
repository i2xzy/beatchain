## Brief

Create a simple react app (using Create React App) that fetches profile data from the GitHub API (e.g. [api.github.com/users/octocat](https://api.github.com/users/octocat)) and displays relevant basic profile information in a nice looking user interface. The user interface should consist of a search box where the user can input a profile to search for, with the result returned below.
